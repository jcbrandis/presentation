# presentation
* Presentation to demonstrate effective communication of a topic set. Files per episode in each folder
* This is meant for you to learn some very basics and by virtue of leaving feedback, this helps my electives
* This is a 100 as opposed 101, suggesting this is merely enough to get you familiar with terms and concepts
* usernames and passwords are for lab purposes only, I recommend you moving on to other subjects leveraging Vault and/or certificates.
* Each folder will include relevant files used in that episode. It is up to you to move them around etc.
* I am not responsible for any damage or damages you may cause to systems
* All topics, terms, are my views and no that of Charles Sturt University, my employer, my client, friends and family. 
* I am a people manager trying to learn, please be gentle in your comments. 
* All the very best in learning
